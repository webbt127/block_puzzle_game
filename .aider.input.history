+I need to improve the dragging on the screen. Placing blocks that are primarily horizontal on the bottom row is difficult due to where the detection area for placement is. Its mostly prevelant when the offset setting is set to high, which is used to prevent the users finger from covering the block while placing. Help me improve this system.

+This is close, but still not quite right. The preview is essentially a copy of the dragged block that snaps to the grid. Theres an offset setting that makes it so that the dragged block and preview aren't occluded by the user's finger. Help me make the necessary corrections.
